### Project Description: **Interactive Quiz Test**

The **Interactive Quiz Test** is a web-based quiz application designed to provide an engaging and user-friendly experience for testing knowledge. The project is built using core web technologies — **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — and follows a clean separation of structure, styling, and logic.

* **index.html**
  This file serves as the backbone of the project. It contains the overall structure and layout of the quiz interface, including sections for displaying questions, answer options, navigation buttons, and score feedback. The HTML ensures the content is semantic and accessible, providing a solid foundation for styling and interactivity.

* **quiz.css**
  All visual elements of the quiz are handled in this file. From background design, typography, and button styling to hover effects and responsive layout adjustments, the CSS ensures that the quiz is not only functional but also visually appealing. It enhances user experience by making the interface clean, modern, and easy to navigate.

* **question.js**
  This file is the logic engine of the quiz. It contains the set of questions, possible answer choices, and correct answers. Additionally, it includes the JavaScript logic to dynamically load questions, validate user responses, update scores, and provide instant feedback. It also manages quiz flow, such as moving to the next question and displaying final results at the end.

Overall, the **Interactive Quiz Test** is a lightweight yet powerful project that demonstrates the integration of **frontend development skills**. It’s a great example of combining structure (HTML), style (CSS), and functionality (JavaScript) to create an interactive web application.
